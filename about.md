Hi! I'm Peter.

I am an engineer, hydrologist and programmer at WMA Water in Sydney. I like to
make things and solve problems. Mostly I write software, sometimes I write on
this here blog, occasionally both. I do full-stack development, from app back-
end and SQL database, to front-end HTML/CSS/JS, to deployment. I also do a lot
of data analysis work, preferably in Python using the dreamy
[`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org) library.

Here are some things I like:

- Maps
- PostGIS
- TUFLOW
- Sublime Text
- SQLAlchemy
- Sharks
- Pandas
- pandas
